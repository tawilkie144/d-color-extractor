# d-color-extractor
A small application to determine the dominant colors from an image. Once colors are determined, will calculate and return those colors as well as optionally Complementary, Monochromatic, Analogous, Triadic, and Tetradic colors based on the dominant colors. Initially will support JPEG colors. Hope to expand to at least PNG but might add support for other formats as well.
